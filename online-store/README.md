## Introduction

Welcome to the React Routing Practical Tasks! This project demonstrates the use of React Router for creating a multi-page application and handling dynamic content rendering based on routes.

## Practical Task Description

### Task 1: Multi-Page Online Store
Create a fictional multi-page Online Store web application. This will be a three-page store with a navigation menu that allows users to switch between different pages:
- Home
- Products
- About

### Task 2: Product Display and Management
1. **Product List**: Display at least 10 product items using Bootstrap cards, including a responsive image, title, short description, price, and a 'buy' button.
2. **Color Options**: Each product should have at least 3 color options using a Bootstrap dropdown button. The dropdown text should update based on the selected color.
3. **Total Price Component**: Create a `TotalPrice.js` component that displays the total price of all purchased products. This component should appear in all pages except Home and should update when a product is bought.
4. **About Page**: Display the store's logo, a short description, two fictional images of the store, and contact information using the React Bootstrap figures component.
5. **Styling**: Ensure the app is styled attractively using custom CSS or other React UI libraries.
